"""The core imports only the standard library, its own package and the workspace kits.

``domain/`` and ``ports/`` are the code a client owns outright after an extraction: the policy,
the decisions and the port contracts. A cloud or model SDK import there is lock-in wearing a
green gate. The rule is an allowlist rather than an SDK blocklist, because a blocklist rots the
day a vendor renames a distribution.

Twin of the core-purity section of the fleet-wide portfolio gate,
which repeats this scan across every repository in the workspace. This copy travels with the
repository when it is extracted and handed over, which is exactly when the workspace scan can
no longer see it.

The dynamic blocked-import probe (``tests/contract/_sdk_free_probe.py``) proves the SDK-free
profiles construct with the SDK unimportable; this static scan additionally catches a lazy
import inside a function body on a call path that profile construction never exercises.

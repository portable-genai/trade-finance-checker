"""The declared MCP schema and the served handler must agree about the payload.

``test_mcp_surface_is_served_and_packaged.py`` already pins the NAMES in both directions, and
``hex_service_kit.mcpserve.bind`` refuses to start on a name mismatch. Neither says anything
about the *payload*: a tool can be declared, bound, served and still describe arguments its
handler never reads, or read arguments the caller was never told to send. That is the defect the
portfolio backlog recorded twice about one tool in ``loan-document-intelligence``:
``cross_validate`` was narrowed once from an unresolvable ``extract_ids`` to a REQUIRED
``documents`` array, and the callable ignored ``documents`` entirely. A peer agent was still
being told to send a payload for a run the tool does not perform.

Both of those narrowings were done by READING, and reading is what missed it the second time.
So this file compares the two sides mechanically. The handlers take ``**arguments``, so there is
no signature to check a schema against; what there is, and what decides the outcome of a call,
is which keys the handler actually reads out of that bag. That is read from the AST rather than
by calling anything, because the handlers are closures over a live container and this has to
hold under the offline gate.

Three conventions are honoured rather than worked around. A handler that declares its bag
``**_`` reads nothing on purpose, and its schema must therefore declare no properties. Keys
reached through a helper taking ``arguments`` count as read by every handler that calls it,
transitively -- several tools in this fleet share one input builder. And ``actor`` is never
askable: it is the verified identity the server resolves, so accepting it from a caller would
be a forged audit subject.

"""The CSP ``frame-ancestors`` allowlist resolved in THREE states, never two.

Red before the fix: ``_frame_ancestors`` read the variable as
``os.environ.get(name, "").strip() or _DEFAULT_FRAME_ANCESTORS``. The ``or`` collapses
"absent" and "present but empty" into one branch, so a deployment whose template rendered
``TRADE_FINANCE_FRAME_ANCESTORS`` empty (a Terraform variable resolving to nothing, a Cloud
Run env var declared with no value, a ``.env`` line left as ``VAR=``) booted happily and
answered ``Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'`` plus
``X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`` : byte-for-byte INDISTINGUISHABLE from never having set the
variable at all. An operator who deliberately empties the allowlist expressed an intent that
names no parent; handing them the unset default instead is reading an absence as consent, and
it grants same-origin framing they did not ask for with no signal that it happened.

Green after: unset keeps the documented restrictive default, set-and-empty is REFUSED at boot
(the resolver runs at import, so the process never starts and serves nothing at all), and
set-and-valid is used verbatim.

These tests assert the SHIPPED response headers from an app booted in a CHILD process, not the
helper's return value. ``_FRAME_ANCESTORS`` is resolved once at import into a module-level
constant, so a test that monkeypatches the environment and calls the helper proves only what
the helper computes, never what a browser receives. The child process is where the
module-level read really runs against the environment under test.

"""The declared tool catalog is now SERVED, and the plugin is rendered from the declarations.

This repo declared its capability surface twice over, as an A2A agent card and as a governed
tool catalog of JSON Schemas, and served neither. There was no MCP server process anywhere in
the fleet, so a surface described in two places could be read by a human and reached by nobody.

These guards are about the seam rather than the transport. What goes wrong here is not that MCP
breaks; it is that the served surface and the declared surface drift apart, so the catalog says
one thing and the process does another. ``bind`` refuses that in both directions.

The MCP SDK is in the ``[gcp]`` extra and the offline gate does not install it, so everything
below uses ``bind``, which is pure.

**What these do NOT prove, stated because the green would otherwise read stronger than it is:**
no handler is EXECUTED here. ``bind`` pairs names with callables and checks nothing about what a
callable does when called, so a handler that reaches for a field its domain object does not have
still binds cleanly. One did, during adoption: a handler filtered a value object as though it
were a list and only reading the domain type caught it. Executing the handlers needs live
services and belongs in the managed suite, not in an offline gate.

"""No CI step may gate itself on a hardcoded calendar date.

This repo shipped a `TEMPORARY: expires 2026-08-06` npm-audit exception whose whole
enforcement was `[[ "$(date -u +%F)" > "2026-08-06" ]]`. That shape fails in both
directions and fails quietly. Before the date, the gate is not the gate anyone reads: it
waves through whatever the inline allowlist happens to name. After the date, nothing
announces the change; the build simply starts failing on a workday for a reason recorded
only in a comment nobody has read since it was written. In this repo's case it was worse
still: the advisory that actually failed the gate (nanoid GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8) was never
on the allowlist, so the exception had stopped permitting anything at all, while the
`overrides` block it relied on pinned postcss AT a flagged version and blocked the
resolver from moving past it.

The repair is a plain hard gate with no date in it. This test is the thing that keeps it
that way: a dated exception can only be reintroduced by deleting an assertion, which is a
visible act, rather than by adding a comment, which is not.

Scope: every file under `.github/workflows/`. The check is for a YYYY-MM-DD literal
appearing in a file that also reads the current date, which is the comparison shape;
a date literal in prose (a changelog reference, an action pin comment) is not a gate and
is not flagged.

Driven RED before being trusted: reintroducing the single line
`if [[ "$(date -u +%F)" > "2026-08-06" ]]; then` into `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` made it
fail with the file, the line number and the offending text.

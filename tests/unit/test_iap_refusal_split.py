"""The three refusals the older IAP adapter did not make, and the transport facts it copied.

This repository carries ``adapters/gcp/iap_identity.py``, the earlier of the two IAP adapter
shapes in this fleet. Measured against ``adapters/gcp/identity.py``, which the rest of the fleet
carries, it was weaker in three ways, and every one of them was reachable without a cloud SDK,
without a credential and without a network. Each is now a refusal, and each test below was
watched failing against the code as it shipped.

**A configuration failure reported as an authentication failure.** An unconfigured audience
raised a plain ``IdentityError``, which ``api/security.py`` answers 401 "authentication
required". An operator reads that and goes looking for a missing credential; no credential would
have helped, because the deployment can authenticate nobody until a variable is set. It was also
checked SECOND, after the assertion header, so the deployment-level failure was only ever
reported to callers who already had an assertion: the operator probing with curl and no header
got "missing IAP assertion header" and learned nothing about the real problem.

**A whitespace-only header taking a different path.** ``ctx.header(...)`` was read without
``.strip()``. A header a proxy or a deployment template rendered blank is truthy, so it skipped
the missing-header refusal entirely and was refused further down by the algorithm pin, which
reports a malformed token for what is actually an absent one.

**A missing extra crashing rather than refusing.** The lazy google-auth import sat outside any
``try``. A deployment without the ``[gcp]`` extra raised ``ModuleNotFoundError`` out of
``resolve``, past ``get_principal``, and FastAPI answered a bare 500 on every request: an empty
error page for the caller and nothing to read for the operator.

The fourth difference between the two families, the ``principals`` tuple, is deliberately NOT
changed here. This adapter grants ``user:<subject>``; the other family grants nothing at all. It
is this one that agrees with ``hex_service_kit.federation.principal_from_iap_claims``, so
"fixing" it toward the other family would remove a verified identity's own principal, which is a
behaviour change and a widening of nothing. That divergence is recorded rather than closed.

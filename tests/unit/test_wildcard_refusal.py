"""Both origin allowlists refuse EVERY spelling of a wildcard, not only the ones with an asterisk.

``TRADE_FINANCE_CORS_ORIGINS`` decides who may call this service from a browser (with
credentials, because the middleware sets ``allow_credentials=True``) and
``TRADE_FINANCE_FRAME_ANCESTORS`` decides who may frame the checker UI. A wildcard in either is
the whole origin policy switched off.

The asterisk half of the rule already existed here. The exact-token half did not, so ``null``
was ACCEPTED by both lists and travelled verbatim into
``CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["null"])`` and ``Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors null``.
That is not a typo case. A sandboxed iframe presents ``null`` as its origin, so the accepted
value hands the checker UI to any page that can sandbox one, which is the framing this policy
exists to refuse, and it does so through the one spelling the asterisk test structurally cannot
see.

``ui/lib/csp.mjs`` has enforced the union (``WILDCARD_TOKENS.has(token) || token.includes("*")``)
for the document a browser actually frames since the UI half of this sweep landed, so until now
the two surfaces of the same product disagreed about what an origin policy may hold. They agree
again after this file.

The spellings that were already refused are pinned here too, and pinned against the WILDCARD
message specifically. Several of them were turned away incidentally, by an origin validator or
by a parse rule rather than by the rule that is supposed to own them, and incidental coverage
moves the day that other rule moves.

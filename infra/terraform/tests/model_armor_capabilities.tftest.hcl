# model_armor_capabilities.tftest.hcl : model_armor_full_capabilities is the one switch for the
# Model Armor capabilities a region may not serve, read as the PLANNED template rather than as
# template text.
#
# Why the file exists: asia-southeast1 refuses a template that asks for the malicious-URI filter
# or multi-language detection with CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED, so the very first apply fails. A
# deployment there sets the variable false, and nothing else proved the switch actually drops
# both blocks, or that it leaves the rest of the guardrail and the API-required
# template_metadata block in place. `terraform validate` cannot see any of that; a plan can.
#
# Mock providers and plan-only, so this runs with NO credentials and NO state, which is what the
# CI gate's terraform test step runs. Every value is fictional.

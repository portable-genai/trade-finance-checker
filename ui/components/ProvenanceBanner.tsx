/**
 * The provenance this console states at the top of every page: WHERE it is running and
 * WHICH model answers (org decision, 2026-08-30).
 *
 * Not cosmetic. This checker is demonstrated on a laptop and on the deployment, sometimes in
 * the same hour, and a screenshot of one is indistinguishable from the other. A viewer who
 * cannot tell which they are looking at cannot tell whether what they are reading came from
 * a real managed service or a deterministic offline stub, and that is exactly the confusion
 * an audit-first pitch cannot afford. The page says it, always, instead of the presenter
 * saying it sometimes.
 *
 * Both values come from `/healthz`; nothing here infers either. A console that read its own
 * runtime from `window.location` would be right until the deployment served through a proxy
 * and wrong silently after that.

// Every security-relevant environment read in `ui/` resolves THREE states, proved by scanning
// the shipped JavaScript and TypeScript.
//
// The Python gate has `tests/unit/test_three_state_env_reads.py`, which fails the build on any
// two-state `os.environ.get(name, default)` in the shipped source. It cannot see this directory:
// it walks `src`, `scripts` and `eval` and parses with `ast`, so no `.mjs`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file
// was ever read. That is not a theoretical hole. `human-review-console` passed the Python
// sweep with three two-state reads in its `ui/` tier, one of which dropped
// Strict-Transport-Security from every response when a variable was emptied.
//
// The rule, mirroring the Python one exactly. `env.X || "default"` and `env.X ?? "default"`
// collapse three states into two:
//
//     unset          -> nobody expressed an intent, so a documented default may stand
//     set and empty  -> an intent WAS expressed and it names nothing, so fail closed
//     set with value -> use it
//
// The middle state is the dangerous one. Folded into the first, a value an operator deliberately
// emptied inherits the default, and where the default is the more permissive branch (a loopback
// API origin widening `connect-src`, a shipped `frame-ancestors`, a demo profile) emptying a
// variable OPENS the console. Worse, the emptied deployment is then byte-identical to one that
// never configured the variable, so a deliberate lockdown cannot be told from an omission.
//
// A Next.js wrinkle makes it worse here than in the service tier: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` reads are
// INLINED AT BUILD TIME, so an emptied value is frozen into the bundle and cannot be corrected
// by fixing the environment at start-up.
//
// The scan is stricter than the two operators the defect wore: it fails on ANY direct
// `process.env.X` read in the shipped source, whatever is done with the value, because
// `const raw = process.env.X; if (!raw) return DEFAULT;` is the same collapse spelled over two
// lines. `lib/env-setting.mjs` returns a setting whose `isUnset` / `isConfiguredEmpty` /
// `hasValue` are mutually exclusive, so the middle state has somewhere to go.
//
// Two escapes, both narrow and both written down:
//
//   1. an EXACT-MATCH relaxation, the raw value compared against a literal
//      (`process.env.X === "1"`). There is no default to inherit and no truthiness to be
//      surprised by, so unset, emptied and "0" alike all mean no. Fail-closed by construction;
//   2. a variable named in TWO_STATE_READS_WITH_A_REASON below, which carries no posture at all.
//      Each entry needs a written reason, and a second test fails the build when an entry stops
//      matching anything, so the exemption list cannot quietly outlive its reads.
//
// `tests/` is not scanned: a test harness legitimately manipulates the environment, and none of
// it ships.

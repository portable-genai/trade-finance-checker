"""Service-to-service (S2S) transport hardening shared by the platform adapters.

The ``platform`` profile's adapters are thin HTTP clients to the sibling
horizontal-platform and de-risking services. Base URLs must be ``https://`` outside
loopback (caught at adapter construction); when ``HRZ_S2S_TOKEN`` is set every request
carries it as an ``Authorization: Bearer`` header, and ``HRZ_S2S_SIGNING_KEY`` optionally
propagates a verified end-user actor as an HMAC-signed ``X-Tf-Actor`` /
``X-Tf-Actor-Sig`` pair.

**Sourced from the shared ``hex-service-kit`` commons.** This module
passes this repo's env-var and header names to :mod:`hex_service_kit.s2s`, so a fix to
the S2S transport rule is a version bump of the package rather than an N-repo edit.

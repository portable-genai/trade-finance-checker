"""On-prem placeholder for ``GuardrailPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Model Armor adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds it here.
The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and structurally satisfies
the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests prove interface parity.
``screen`` deliberately raises rather than fail-opening: an unimplemented guardrail must
never silently allow traffic, so porting on-premise *must* provide a real screening
backend. Filling this body in is the only change required.

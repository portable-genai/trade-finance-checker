"""On-prem placeholder for ``AgentRuntimePort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Agent Runtime (ex-Agent Engine) adapter; switching ``profile`` to
``onprem`` rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external
dependencies** and structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the
contract tests prove interface parity. Porting B4 to an on-premise hosting platform is
*only* a matter of filling these bodies in : the domain orchestration is unchanged.

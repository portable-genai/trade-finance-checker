"""On-prem placeholder for ``ObservabilityTracerPort`` : Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders. Unlike the safety/audit
stubs, tracing is **non-essential to correctness**, so this placeholder makes tracing
simply *absent* on-prem rather than fatal:

* ``span`` returns a no-op context manager (``contextlib.nullcontext``), so domain code
  that wraps work in ``tracer.span(...)`` runs unchanged : the block just executes with no
  span recorded.
* ``record_token_usage`` is a no-op, so FinOps metric emission silently does nothing.

This lets the whole pipeline run on an on-premise install with no observability backend
wired up yet, instead of crashing on a missing tracer. A real on-prem tracer (e.g. an
internal OpenTelemetry collector) can be filled in later without touching domain logic.
The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and structurally satisfies
the same Protocol as the managed adapter.

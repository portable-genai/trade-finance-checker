"""On-prem placeholder for ``AuditSinkPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Cloud Logging locked-WORM-bucket adapter; switching ``profile`` to
``onprem`` rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external
dependencies** and structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the
contract tests prove interface parity. ``record`` deliberately raises rather than
discarding the event: an unimplemented audit sink must never silently drop a compliance
record, so porting on-premise *must* supply a real immutable (WORM) audit store. Filling
this body in is the only change required.

"""On-prem placeholder for ``LLMPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Gemini adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds it here. The
adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and structurally satisfies the
same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests prove interface parity. Porting
B4 on-premise is *only* a matter of filling these bodies in : the domain orchestration and
service callers do not change.

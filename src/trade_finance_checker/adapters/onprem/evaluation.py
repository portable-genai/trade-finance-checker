"""On-prem placeholder for ``EvaluationGatePort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Gen AI evaluation-service adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem``
rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and
structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests
prove interface parity. ``evaluate`` deliberately raises rather than returning a
vacuously-passing report: an unimplemented promotion gate must never wave a build through
unevaluated, so porting on-premise *must* supply a real eval backend. Filling this body in
is the only change required.

"""On-prem IdentityPort placeholder : integrate the client's own enterprise IdP here.

In the managed profile this port binds to the IAP-verified-assertion adapter; switching
``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds it here. Fill this in to verify your enterprise IdP's
token/assertion (OIDC/SAML) and map the verified claims to a :class:`Principal`. Like the
other on-prem placeholders it constructs with no external dependency and fails fast rather
than trusting an unauthenticated caller: an unverified identity must never be accepted
(this is the seam that defeats actor spoofing and the confused-deputy risk).

"""On-prem placeholder for ``PIIRedactionPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Sensitive Data Protection / DLP adapter; switching ``profile`` to
``onprem`` rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external
dependencies** and structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the
contract tests prove interface parity. ``redact`` deliberately raises rather than passing
text through unredacted: an unimplemented redactor must never leak trade-party PII to a
model or audit sink (P-04), so porting on-premise *must* supply a real de-identifier.
Filling this body in is the only change required.

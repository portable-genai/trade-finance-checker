"""On-prem placeholder for ``ReviewRouterPort`` -- the sovereign target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this port
binds to the Hrz7 submission adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds it here. The
adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and structurally satisfies the same
Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests prove interface parity. ``route``
deliberately raises rather than silently dropping the escalation: an unimplemented router must
never let a consequential report bypass human review (P-06, rule R8), so porting on-premise
*must* supply a real hand-off to the sovereign review console. Filling this body in is the only
change required.

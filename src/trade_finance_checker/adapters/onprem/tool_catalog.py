"""On-prem placeholder for ``ToolCatalogPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the MCP tool-catalog adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds it
here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and structurally
satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests prove interface
parity. Porting the governed, least-privilege tool catalog to an on-premise registry is
*only* a matter of filling these bodies in : the domain is unchanged.

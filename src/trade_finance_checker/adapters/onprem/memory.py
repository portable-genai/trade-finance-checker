"""On-prem placeholder for ``MemoryPort`` : the Google Distributed Cloud target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this
port binds to the Agent Platform Memory Bank adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem``
rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and
structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests
prove interface parity. Porting durable officer memory to an on-premise store is *only* a
matter of filling these bodies in : the domain is unchanged.

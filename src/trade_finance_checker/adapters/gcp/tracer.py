"""Managed ObservabilityTracerPort: OpenTelemetry through the agent-observability collector.

This adapter is deliberately thin. The OpenTelemetry work lives in ``hex_service_kit.tracing`` (the
kit's ``otel`` extra): the OTLP exporter, the ID token the private Cloud Run collector requires,
and the rule that a tracing fault never becomes a request fault are implemented once for the fleet
rather than per repository.

Spans go OTLP to the collector named by ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``, which deletes GenAI
content attributes before anything reaches a Google sink. There is no direct Cloud Trace path.
This repository used to carry its own ``CloudTraceSpanExporter`` tracer, which exported straight
to Cloud Trace and so around that redaction; it was retired onto the kit in phase P4 of the
guardrail/registry/observability plan. The kit refuses to build a tracer when the endpoint is
unset or empty (decision D1), so a ``gcp`` deployment that has not wired the collector fails
loudly on its first span instead of exporting around it.

Only structural attributes go on a span, never message content: callers pass ids and metadata,
and the collector's redaction is the backstop, not the contract.

The kit import is lazy (practice A5): the local and on-prem profiles import this package with no
cloud SDK installed.

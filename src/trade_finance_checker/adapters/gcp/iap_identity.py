"""GCP IdentityPort adapter: verify the Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) signed assertion.

In secure mode the deployment is fronted by Cloud IAP (Cloud Run behind an HTTPS load
balancer + IAP), which authenticates the user against the configured IdP (Workspace, or an
external client IdP via Workforce Identity Federation) and injects a signed JWT in the
``x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion`` header. This adapter VERIFIES that assertion (signature,
audience, issuer, expiry) and derives the :class:`Principal` server-side, so authentication
is configured ON the GCP service rather than hand-rolled in the app. The Google SDK imports
are lazy (mirroring the other gcp adapters) so the SDK-free local/onprem profiles never
import them, and the verified assertion is never logged.

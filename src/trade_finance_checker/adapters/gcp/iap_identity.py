"""GCP IdentityPort adapter: verify the Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) signed assertion.

In secure mode the deployment is fronted by Cloud IAP (Cloud Run behind an HTTPS load
balancer + IAP), which authenticates the user against the configured IdP (Workspace, or an
external client IdP via Workforce Identity Federation) and injects a signed JWT in the
``x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion`` header. This adapter VERIFIES that assertion (signature,
audience, issuer, expiry) and derives the :class:`Principal` server-side, so authentication
is configured ON the GCP service rather than hand-rolled in the app. The Google SDK imports
are lazy (mirroring the other gcp adapters) so the SDK-free local/onprem profiles never
import them, and the verified assertion is never logged.

# could drift without anything noticing. Rebinding makes a divergence between this adapter and
# the reviewed set impossible rather than merely unlikely.

#: to a tenant id, no domain is mapped to a group, and the hosted domain IS the tenant id
#: here.
#:
#: ``tenant_from_hosted_domain`` is ON, and it is an OPT-IN rather than a fallback. IAP
#: restricts the audience to one organisation on this deployment, so the ``hd`` claim and the
#: tenant partition are the same string. Left OFF, these same assertions would resolve to no
#: tenant at all: fail-closed, but closed for every verified user, and an offline gate would
#: not notice, because the local profile never constructs this adapter. Writing the choice
#: down is what makes it readable and testable; a silent fallback would be neither.

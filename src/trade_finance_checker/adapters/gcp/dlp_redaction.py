"""Sensitive Data Protection (DLP) redaction adapter (A1 Guardrail Gateway).

Implements :class:`PIIRedactionPort` against **Sensitive Data Protection / DLP** of the
Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform. Every LC, document extract and response is de-identified
at the boundary : before it reaches a model or the WORM audit sink : so trade-party PII
(beneficiary, applicant, account numbers) is minimised to the model (P-04). The call is
regional (``projects/{project}/locations/{region}``) to keep inspection inside Singapore
for Transaction Banking residency.

If inspect/de-identify templates are configured in settings, they are used as-is.
Otherwise the adapter builds an inline configuration that masks the built-in info types most
relevant to trade finance (names, emails, phone numbers, IBANs, SWIFT codes) plus the
national identifiers and account-number shape for the jurisdictions configured in
``settings.pii.jurisdictions``, sourced from ``domain/pii_patterns.py``. That shared source
is the point: the managed and local redactors detect the same identifiers, so switching
profile does not silently change what is masked, and the eval gate scores the same shapes it
redacts.

Three known deviations from the ``local`` redactor, all stated rather than papered over:

* A DLP custom info type is regex-only, with no hook for a checksum, so the JP My Number, AU
  TFN and bare HK HKID rows are matched here on shape alone while ``local`` additionally
  checksum-gates them. The managed profile therefore masks strictly MORE than local, which is
  the fail-safe direction at a redaction boundary.
* DLP matches custom info types with **RE2**, which has no lookaround, so a row whose Python
  regex uses one cannot be sent verbatim: DLP rejects the entire inspect config with
  INVALID_ARGUMENT, which fails the call rather than degrading it. The pack owns an RE2-safe
  form per affected row (`re2_pattern_for`, today only `JP_MY_NUMBER`) so the two forms
  cannot drift; what RE2 loses there is only the rejection of a 12-digit prefix of a longer
  GROUPED run, i.e. it masks more.
* This adapter carries no bank-account regex of its own. A private
  ``\\b\\d[\\d-]{7,16}\\d\\b`` here is one the local redactor and the eval gate never
  share, and being hyphen-tolerant and eight-digits-wide it matches every ISO date
  (``2026-06-15``), which would mask the shipment and expiry dates out of the managed
  profile's own audit trail. The pack's contiguous ``BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER`` row is the
  shape the SDK-free gate actually proves. A corridor that settles on hyphenated account
  numbers should configure a de-identify template (below) rather than introduce a private
  pattern here.

The ``google.cloud.dlp_v2`` import is lazy so on-prem and test profiles load this module
with no GCP SDK installed.

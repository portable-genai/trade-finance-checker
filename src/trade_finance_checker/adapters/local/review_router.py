"""Local ReviewRouterPort: enqueue the routed review to an in-memory outbox (no live Hrz7).

Exercises the R8 routing path offline: an escalated report is converted to a review and enqueued
(the same transactional outbox the platform adapter flushes to Hrz7), so tests and the offline
demo can assert that an escalation is routed without a running console.

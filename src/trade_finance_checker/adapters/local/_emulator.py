"""Optional Google emulator detection for the ``local`` profile (opt-in, never required).

For the stores that have an official Google emulator, the local adapters can route to
it for higher-fidelity local development WHEN the standard emulator env var is set AND
the matching client library (from the ``[gcp]`` extra) imports. Otherwise the adapters
use their SDK-free SQLite / in-process path, which is the default.

This module only *detects* the opt-in; it deliberately performs **no google-cloud
import at module top level**. Each adapter that supports an emulator imports the google
client lazily, inside the method, and only on the emulator branch, so the default local
path and the offline test suite never import a google-cloud package.

There is no emulator for Document AI, Gemini, Model Armor or DLP, so those adapters stay
on the SDK-free workaround unconditionally.

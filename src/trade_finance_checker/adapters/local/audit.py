"""Local audit adapter (AuditSinkPort) : append-only, hash-chained local WORM stand-in.

The ``local`` profile's stand-in for the **Cloud Logging locked WORM bucket**. Sourced
from the shared ``hex-service-kit`` commons: the store is
:class:`hex_service_kit.audit.HashChainedAuditLog`, an append-only SQLite table (or
in-memory for ``:memory:``) where every record is chained to its predecessor
(``entry_hash = SHA-256(prev_hash || "\\n" || event_json)``) and UPDATE/DELETE are
rejected by triggers. The trail exports to / restores from JSON Lines with the chain
re-verified line by line.

Honest limits (C9): ``verify_chain`` catches in-place edits, interior deletions and
reordering; it cannot by itself detect a truncated tail or a full rewrite by an actor
with file write access. The managed profile's locked WORM bucket provides
non-rewritability itself.

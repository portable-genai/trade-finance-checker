"""Live LLM adapter (LLMPort): the fleet's shared local open-weight model.

The ``live`` profile's generator. The discrepancy explanations and report prose are produced
by a model running on the operator's own machine, reached through the ONE client every laptop
``live`` lane uses, :class:`hex_service_kit.localmodel.LocalModelClient`. Its endpoint, model
and timeout are the fleet-wide ``LOCAL_MODEL_URL``, ``LOCAL_MODEL`` and
``LOCAL_MODEL_TIMEOUT`` (three-state, read by the kit), so this repository carries no model
server settings of its own. Every discrepancy VERDICT stays with the deterministic detector:
this model only narrates.

Structured output: the kit states the request's JSON schema in the prompt, strips a fence,
validates the answer against the schema and feeds any problem back for a bounded number of
retries. The validated value is re-serialised as the response text, so the domain's parser
reads clean JSON.

Failures propagate as the kit raises them (:class:`LocalModelUnavailable`,
:class:`LocalModelOutputError`), exactly as the Gemini adapter lets its SDK errors propagate:
the service treats a failed narrative as presentation, never fatal, and falls back to the
deterministic one in both profiles.

Grounding discipline is unchanged from the managed adapter: the model may cite only the
``[source_id p.N]`` headers present in the passage block it was given, and the services map
those ids back to real retrieved passages, so a hallucinated id cites nothing rather than
inventing provenance.

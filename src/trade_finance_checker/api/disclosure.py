"""Put what the runtime controls did on a response, so the user who asked can see it.

Two fields, defined on every response model that can carry them:

* ``input_redacted``: redaction changed the presented LC or documents before the model saw them.
* ``review_routing``: what happened to the human-review hand-off, one of ``routed``,
  ``failed``, ``off`` or ``not_required``.

The values come from the request-scoped wrappers in :mod:`..adapters.controls`, which the
route receives from the same FastAPI dependency its service was built with.

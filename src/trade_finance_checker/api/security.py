"""FastAPI security dependency: resolve a verified Principal (never client-asserted).

Builds a :class:`RequestContext` from the inbound request headers and asks the active
profile's :class:`IdentityPort` adapter to resolve a verified :class:`Principal`. The
request-body ``actor``/ACL are ignored entirely: the audit actor and the entitlement
principals flow from here, closing the spoofable-identity gap. A failure to resolve a
verified principal is a 401.

The IdentityPort is the inner ring of the defense-in-depth PEP (edge IAP/Apigee ->
Hrz1 guardrail -> this per-backend check); this module is the per-backend ring.

"""IdentityPort : resolve a verified Principal from inbound transport context.

The hexagon boundary for authentication. The API layer hands the adapter a
:class:`RequestContext` (the request headers) and gets back a verified :class:`Principal`,
or an :class:`IdentityError`. The active profile picks the adapter:

* ``local`` resolves a seeded dev persona (no IdP/AD/LDAP) so demos and tests run offline,
* ``gcp`` / ``platform`` verify the Identity-Aware-Proxy-injected signed assertion (auth
  configured on the GCP service), and
* ``onprem`` is the placeholder for the client's own enterprise IdP (OIDC/SAML).

This keeps the per-user identity decision swappable by configuration, exactly like every
other port (P-02), and is the single seam where the client-asserted actor/ACL is replaced
by a server-verified one.

The Protocol itself is RE-EXPORTED from :mod:`hex_service_kit.identity` rather than declared
here. It was hand-copied into this repo and its siblings, which is how a Protocol becomes N
Protocols that quietly disagree; ``tests/contract/test_port_parity.py`` now asserts this name
IS the commons object, which structural conformance cannot check.

# What an identity adapter DECLARES about the end-user authentication it provides.
#
# The exposure guard on the app object has one question to answer before it can decide
# anything: are this service's END-USER routes authenticated? Nothing else in the
# configuration answers it.
#
# * The PROFILE names an adapter family, not an authentication scheme. A deliberate ``local``
#   and an inherited one bind the same seeded personas, ``live`` binds those SAME personas
#   while reading as a non-local profile string everywhere else, and a client's own IdP
#   adapter can be bound under ``onprem`` without the profile string changing at all.
# * The SERVICE-TO-SERVICE secret authenticates a calling SERVICE. It authenticates no end
#   user, so its presence is not evidence that an end-user route is protected. Deriving the
#   guard from it would switch the guard OFF for the very routes it was protecting.
#
# The adapter bound to the identity port is the only thing that knows, so it says so here.
